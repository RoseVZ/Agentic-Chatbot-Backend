Hi! I’m Priyanka Rose Varghese, a second-year Master’s student in Computer Science at Columbia University, specializing in Machine Learning. I’m passionate about building intelligent, user-centric systems — from LLM-powered cloud debugging tools to interactive portfolio experiences and AI-driven resume tailoring. My work spans the full stack, and I love bringing ideas to life through a mix of research, engineering, and design.

But beyond the code, I’m someone who thrives at the intersection of logic and art.

I’m a trained Bharatanatyam dancer and a lifelong student of Carnatic music. I’m a huge fan of psychological thrillers, crime mysteries, and anime that explore the human mind. I also had a pretty intense K-pop phase, and I still enjoy revisiting those songs and fandom vibes from time to time.

I believe that curiosity across domains fuels innovation — and that art, storytelling, and engineering are deeply interconnected.
