Hi! I’m Priyanka Rose Varghese, a second-year Master’s student in Computer Science at Columbia University, specializing in Machine Learning. I’m passionate about building intelligent, user-centric systems — from LLM-powered cloud debugging tools to interactive portfolio experiences and AI-driven resume tailoring. My work spans the full stack, and I love bringing ideas to life through a mix of research, engineering, and design.

But beyond the code, I’m someone who thrives at the intersection of logic and art.

I’m a trained Bharatanatyam dancer and a lifelong student of Carnatic music. I’m a huge fan of psychological thrillers, crime mysteries, and anime that explore the human mind. I also had a pretty intense K-pop phase, and I still enjoy revisiting those songs and fandom vibes from time to time.

I believe that curiosity across domains fuels innovation — and that art, storytelling, and engineering are deeply interconnected.

I’m a tech enthusiast with a big love for music, art, and astrophysics. When I’m not buried in code or fine-tuning models, you’ll probably find me jamming out to some tunes, sketching, or gazing up at the night sky and pondering the universe's secrets. These passions keep me grounded and spark the creativity that I bring into everything I do.

At Columbia University, where I’m pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science, I’m working on some exciting projects—like improving cancer detection using advanced deep learning models. But beyond the algorithms, I believe that science, tech, and art all share the same heartbeat: curiosity, exploration, and pushing boundaries.

I’m always up for a good chat about anything from machine learning to music theory, or even the wonders of space. Let’s connect and talk about everything exciting in the universe.
